Telephone Directory in C

A simple yet efficient Telephone Directory Management System built using C and Linked Lists.
This project allows users to store, search, edit, delete, and organize contacts directly from the terminal — all while ensuring data persistence and validation for reliable record management.

 Features:

 Add New Contacts — store names with up to 3 unique phone numbers each.

Search Contacts — quickly find a contact by name.

 Edit & Update — modify existing contact details easily.

 Delete Contacts — remove unwanted entries.

Persistent Storage — all contacts are saved in contacts.txt.

Input Validation — allows only 10-digit unique phone numbers.

 Sort Alphabetically — organize contacts A–Z for better readability.

Language: C

Data Structure: Singly Linked List

File Handling: Text File (contacts.txt) for persistent storage

 Concepts Covered:
